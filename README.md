### A 2D game Developed using Unity 3D and JetBrain's Rider. 
I made this game as my software Engineering project. And I had added some smart enemy bots in it. 
This Game I reather simple and small, As it consists of only few Stages. <br>
Later on when I will get more time, I will add more stages and additional features into it so that the game becomes interactive and ready for deployment.
